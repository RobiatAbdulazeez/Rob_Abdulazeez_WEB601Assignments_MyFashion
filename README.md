My Application theme is a fashion theme in this project i generated the content-card folder,which automatically generates other components of the content-card,after that i created an instance of my content list and i was able to add my theme properties using the addItem function that was defined in my content-list.ts i also created a templete in my content-card component.html and content-card component.scss this is the basic templete for my application,i had few issues while working on this but i was able to track back using the plugins and the console in my web browser.
